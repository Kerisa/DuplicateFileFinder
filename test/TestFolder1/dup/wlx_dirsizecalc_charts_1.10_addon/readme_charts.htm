      <p>DirSizeCalc Charts is a Lister plug-in for the file manager
        Total Commander. It displays a list of all files and folders
        contained in a folder sorted descending by size. A bar chart is
        displayed next to the items to illustrate the size dimensions at
        first glance.<br>

      </p>
      <h2>2. Use<a name="use"></a></h2>
      In order to use DirSizeCalc Charts select a folder in Total
      Commander and press F3 to display the folder size information in a
      new Lister window or press Ctrl+Q to display the folder size
      information in the Quickview window.<br>
      If something else is displayed you might want to have a look a the
      Lister plugin hierarchy in the Lister settings in Total Commander.
      Press '4' to navigate between installed Lister plugins capable of
      handling folders. In some cases you might have to press '4' twice.
      It's a known issue.<br>
      <h3><a name="2.1_Navigate"></a>2.1 Navigate<a name="navigate"></a></h3>
      In order to navigate between folders press 'Return' or doubleclick
      on the subfolder. In order to navigate to parent directory you
      have to press 'Backspace'.<br>
      <h3><a name="2.2_Delete_items"></a>2.2 Delete items<a
          name="delete_items"></a></h3>
      You may move items to the recycle bin by pressing 'Delete'. If
      moving to recycle bin isn't possible, the files will be deleted.
      In all cases you have to confirm the operation.<br>
      <h3>2.3 Additional values for displayed values <a
          name="additional_information"></a></h3>
      <p>DirSizeCalc shows some tokens in front of the calculation
        result, if the complete directory content couldn't be retrieved.
        This can be the case for several reasons: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>AD = Access denied. This error is displayed if the current
          user has no sufficient access permissions for opening the
          directory. </li>
        <li>U = Unreadable Unicode name. This error occurs if file name
          contains characters which don't match the currently set
          Windows code page and you have deactivated storing of short
          file names.</li>
        <li>E = Unknown error. Unknown error should not be displayed at
          all. When it's displayed please report it to me.</li>
        <li>NF = Not followed reparse point. The user has set the option
          to now follow reparse points which results in not including
          these these files in the calculation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2.4 Size display of (almost) empty directories <a
          name="empty_directory_display"></a></h3>
      <p>There can be multiple reasons for a directory size of 0 bytes.
        This information is displayed left to the size when appropriate.
        The following cases are distinguished: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The directory contains only files of size 0. In this case
          DirSizeCalc displays 0 as size.</li>
        <li>The directory contains only empty subdirectories but no
          files. In this case "No files" is being displayed.</li>
        <li>The directory is really empty In this case "Empty is being
          displayed. </li>
      </ul>
